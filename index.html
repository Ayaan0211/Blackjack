            <h3>How The Game Works:</h3>
            <p>-The player starts by pressing Start Game</p>
            <p>-The goal is to get an exact value of 21</p>
            <p>-The player continues drawing cards until '21' is hit, he cashes out, or the sum goes over 21</p>
            <p>-If the player cashes out he receives 50% of his money back</p>
            <p>-If the player goes over '21', he loses 50% of his money</p>
            <p>-If the player hits '21' he will 5x his money</p>
            <p>Cards 2-10 have the corresponding values, while face cards have a value of 10</p>
            <p>If a 1 is drawn, players will have the option of choosing a 1 or 11</p>
